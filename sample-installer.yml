        This is the installation program for $program $version.

        I will ask you where you want $program installed, and then I will
        ask you an additional question which you may answer or not, I
        don't care as my purpose is to demonstrate the smartsetup utility,
        not to do anything useful.

        I will also write a file called install.log on your home directory.

    - title: Destination Directory
      type: inputbox
      text: |
        I need to know the location of the destination directory.

        Please enter the full path where you want this software installed.
        Better enter a directory that exists because I'm not creating it
        if not. A real setup program should, but I am not one.
        (e.g. /opt/$program/$version)
      default: /home/$USER/$program
      store: destdir

    - title: Enter the Special Code
      type: inputbox
      text: |
        If you the Special Code you can enter it now:

        (e.g. XVTR-2342-SEKRETT)
      store: specialcode

    - title: Warning
      condition: -z "$specialcode"
      type: msgbox
      text: |
        You haven't entered the Special Code.

        The installation will proceed, but it will self-destruct in 10
        days unless you enter a valid Special Code in the configuration
        file.

        Press OK to continue.
